          If you’re into space age mystery, sci-fi spaceships, and Matthew
          McConaughey being humanity’s last hope, then you’ll like Interstellar.

          sometime after 2010 because of the tech. Our main character, Cooper
          (played by Matthew McConaughey), has a daughter named Murph (Mackenzie
          Foy) and a son named Tom (Timothée Chalamet). They live a simple life

          to live day by day in a blight-ridden land. After weird happenings
          occur at their farm - tractors all pointing to their house and
          dust-lines in Murph’s room reading out to Morse Code - they use the
          Morse Code to locate a secret facility unbeknownst to the rest of the
          world. Once taken inside, after running into some kind of robot, they
          find out that this hidden facility is actually

            style="color: blue"
            >NASA</a
          >, hidden away from the rest of the world. As the blight grew stronger
          and people started to perish after the food wars, all funding to NASA
          was cut from the government. So, NASA went into hiding to try and come
          up with a solution to the Earth’s problem. Professor Brand, played by
          Michael Caine, is the head of NASA and has devised two methods on how
          to save humanity as it is obvious humanity will perish if left on
          Earth. One method is to send fertilized human eggs to another
          habitable planet and start fresh on a new world. The other method
          involves trying to save Earth’s population - 8 billion strong.
          However, that second method requires an equation to be solved that
          Professor Brand just can’t crack. Cooper is asked to pilot their last
          ship, the Endurance, to find the habitable planets through a

          and save humanity. However, that will require him to leave Murph and
          Tom behind and the possibility of never seeing them again. Will Cooper
          choose to try and save humanity or will he stay with Murph and Tom and
          live out the rest of his life as a farmer?

          Matthew McConaughey’s acting throughout the movie was superb.

            >Writer Matt Zoller Seitz of rogerebert.com</a
          >
          describes McConaughey as “a super-intense actor who wholeheartedly
          commits to every line and moment he's given, is the right leading man
          for this kind of film” (Seitz, n.d.). From the torn Cooper leaving his
          family on Earth to his rage when he realizes he should’ve stayed back
          home, Matthew McConaughey’s portrayal as a broken man looking for
          adventure while still wanting to care for his son and daughter is a
          true masterpiece. One of the most iconic acting scenes from the movie
          is when Cooper wakes from cryo-sleep and realizes that they have been
          asleep for 27 years. Before Cooper and his team enter the wormhole, he
          reviews the video messages from his son and daughter back home. The
          videos initially start off from his son talking about how his life is
          going. Cooper shows a sign of hope in his eyes and triumph as his son
          is doing better than ever. As more videos progress and he finally gets
          to Murph’s video, you can tell he is starting to break down and is on
          the verge of tears. Throughout Murph’s video, Cooper is holding back
          his cries and tears as best he can. In this scene it really feels like
          McConaughey is feeling pain. Through this scene and many others,
          whenever McConaughey is on set, it is never a dull moment.

          This question may have a different meaning to everyone. For me
          however, Interstellar was so special because it explored questions
          humanity has no answer to while still providing an enjoyable
          experience. There are a lot of documentaries that explore the topic of
          wormholes or blackholes or space itself, but they don’t offer the same
          level of enjoyability as Interstellar does. It provides a purpose on
          why we need to know the answers to these questions and thrusts the
          watcher into having to watch Cooper and his crew figure out the
          answers for themselves.

          Everyone has something that they think would make a movie better. In
          this case, I believe the film has a bit of a hiccup during the part
          with Murph and her Brother Tom. The conflict is that her brother
          thinks farming is the only way to save humanity and that their father
          is gone forever. Murph on the other hand believes that she is one step
          away from solving the equation and saving humanity. So, in an effort
          to protect their house, Murph sets the cornfield on fire to distract
          Tom. I think that this is a bit off track from the beginning of the
          movie where Tom is very supportive of his father for going out and
          saving humanity. I think that there could’ve been a different conflict
          here as throughout most of the movie, other than where Tom is sending
          videos to Cooper of his life, we don’t hear or see much of Tom. It’s
          just all the sudden he wants Murph to stop everything she is doing for
          NASA and to help with the farm - as if this was never a problem
          before, it just became a problem now.

          In the end, I still think Interstellar is a fantastic movie and
          definitely interested me more into the vast unknown we call space.
          Interstellar was another great movie that inspired many people into
          knowing more about space. The film is a great sci-fi, adventure, drama
          that is somewhat educational in a way. Funny enough, in the early
          production of the movie, Dr. Kip Throne who helped with the creation
          of the script laid down two guidelines,

            >“...nothing would violate established physical laws, and that all
            the wild speculations would spring from science, and not from the
            creative mind of a screenwriter”</a
          >
          (IMDb, n.d.). So they really wanted to make sure that Interstellar
          could be as realistic as possible. More of a possible future epic
          rather than another strange space movie. My final rating of
          Interstellar is an 8 out of 10.
